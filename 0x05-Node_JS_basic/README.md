# Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side, or backend, and communicate with a web browser or mobile device through APIs.

## How Node.js works

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which means that instead of blocking the execution of a program while it waits for an operation to complete, Node.js will initiate the operation and continue executing the program. When the operation is complete, an event is triggered and a callback function is called.

## Installing Node.js

You can download Node.js from the official website: <https://nodejs.org/en/download/>

## Getting started with Node.js

After installing Node.js, open a terminal or command prompt and type `node` to start the Node.js REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).

console.log("Hello, World!");
